** VisualDEP - Visualization of Differences in Electrostatic Potentials

* What is VisualDEP?:
VisualDEP is webserver developed in the Laboratorio de Biofísica Molecuar
of Universidad de Concepción. VisualDEP aims to compare two highly similar
proteins with respect to their electrostatic properties. This comparison is 
done calculating the difference in electrostatic potential at atomic level 
of both proteins.

* How to install?

First edit the configuration files:

src/config.py:          Edit with proper information of where the system
                        will it be, database and other system information.

configs/visualdepd:     /etc/rc.d/ script to have visualdep as a service

visualde.ngingx.conf:   Ngninx web server configuration


Then copy the configuration where have to be.

+ Compile pqr2csv
cd src/scripts
gcc pqr2csv.c -o pqr2csv
chmod +x pqr2csv
